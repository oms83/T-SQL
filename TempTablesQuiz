Introduction to Temporary Tables
Temporary tables in T-SQL are used to store and process intermediate results. These tables are created in the tempdb database and are automatically deleted when they are no longer used. 
Temporary tables are particularly useful in complex SQL operations where intermediate results need to be stored temporarily.

Types of Temporary Tables
Local Temporary Tables: Created with a single hash (#) symbol. Visible only to the connection that creates it and are deleted when the connection is closed.
Syntax: CREATE TABLE #TempTable (...)
Global Temporary Tables: Created with a double hash (##) symbol. Visible to all connections and are deleted when the last connection using it is closed.
Syntax: CREATE TABLE ##TempTable (...)
Advantages of Temporary Tables
Performance: Can improve performance in complex queries by breaking them into simpler parts.
Complex Data Processing: Useful for storing intermediate results in complex data processing.
Transaction Management: Changes in a temporary table are not logged extensively, which can be beneficial in large transactions.

Cleaning Up
Temporary tables are automatically deleted when the session that created them ends. However, it's often considered good practice to explicitly drop them when they are no longer needed.


Conclusion:

Temporary tables are a powerful feature in T-SQL, allowing for efficient handling of complex queries and data processing tasks. Their ability to store intermediate results and 
their scope of visibility make them a versatile tool for database developers and administrators. Understanding when and how to use temporary tables can significantly optimize SQL operations.

What are temporary tables used for?
Storing and processing intermediate results

Where are temporary tables created?
In the tempdb database

What is the advantage of using temporary tables?
Improved performance in complex queries

How are local temporary tables different from global temporary tables?
Local temporary tables are deleted when the connection is closed, while global temporary tables are deleted when the last connection using them is closed
